# Stack_array

Stack is a linear Data Structure that is based on the LIFO concept (last in first out). Instead of only an Integer Stack, Stack can be of String, Character, or even Float type. There are 4 primary operations in the stack as follows:

push() Method adds element x to the stack.
pop() Method removes the last element of the stack.
top() Method returns the last element of the stack.
empty() Method returns whether the stack is empty or not.
